Translating text from photo. Also works just like a usual real-time translator

Using SnapKit, MVC

Needs OCRSpace API Key, YandexCloud API Key, YandexCloud folder ID 

OCR is provided by OCRSpace
Limit of photo in free version is 1MB, so image compression for POST request is 0.3, but still doesnt work sometimes on iPhone 11
Also, I guess thats the reason why OCR sometimes works badly with spacing and text recognition

Translating is provided by Yandex Translator API
